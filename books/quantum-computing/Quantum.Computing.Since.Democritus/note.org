** Why "countable" is such an important concept in Maths?
*** Our brain are weak when dealing with infinity
*** But we can easily turn "countable" into finite things!
+ Induction is common in proof. It actually converts infinite proofs into finte ones.
+ Compactness of propositional logic is also converting infinity to finite stuff.
+ Pull down automata is another example of this idea.
